## Wind Power
```{r}
raw <- read_excel("Global-Wind-Power-Tracker-February-2025.xlsx", sheet = "Data")
head(raw)

# selecting variables
onlycolumns <- raw[, c("Date Last Researched", "Country/Area", "Project Name", "Phase Name", "Capacity (MW)", "Status", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Local area (taluk, county)", "State/Province")]
head(onlycolumns)

# rename columns
onlycolumns <- onlycolumns %>% rename(Country = `Country/Area`, County = `Local area (taluk, county)`, State=`State/Province`)

# subset rows to only USA
cleaned <- onlycolumns %>% filter(Country=="United States")
head(cleaned)

# check the types of statuses
unique(onlycolumns$Status)
# keep operating, construction
  # maybe include pre-construction? this phase is where govt approval is being sought
# subset status rows
cleaned <- cleaned %>% filter(Status==c("operating", "construction"))

# subset - get latest date for each project
  # also filter by phase name bc some projects have multiple phases in 1 year - get latest one (most are numerals)
cleaned <- cleaned %>% group_by(`Project Name`) %>%
  arrange(desc(`Date Last Researched`), desc(`Phase Name`)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup()

cleaned_wind <- cleaned
cleaned_wind
```

Do the same for the other sheet (below capacity).
```{r}
raw_below <- read_excel("Global-Wind-Power-Tracker-February-2025.xlsx", sheet = "Below Threshold")

# selecting variables
onlycolumns_below <- raw_below[, c("Date Last Researched", "Country/Area", "Project Name", "Phase Name", "Capacity (MW)", "Status", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Local area (taluk, county)", "State/Province")]
head(onlycolumns_below)

# rename columns
onlycolumns_below <- onlycolumns_below %>% rename(Country = `Country/Area`, County = `Local area (taluk, county)`, State=`State/Province`)

# subset rows to only USA
cleaned_below <- onlycolumns_below %>% filter(Country=="United States")
head(cleaned_below)

# check the types of statuses
unique(onlycolumns$Status)
# keep operating, construction
  # maybe include pre-construction? this phase is where govt approval is being sought
# subset status rows
cleaned_below <- cleaned_below %>% filter(Status==c("operating", "construction"))

# subset - get latest date for each project
  # dont filter by phases here bc all have weird names, not numerical
cleaned_below <- cleaned_below %>%
  group_by(`Project Name`) %>%
  slice_max(`Date Last Researched`, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
  ungroup()

cleaned_below
```

Combine the two datasets.
```{r}
nrow(cleaned_wind) + nrow(cleaned_below) # 691 rows

wind <- rbind(cleaned_wind, cleaned_below)
nrow(wind)

# dont need phase name column
wind <- wind %>% select(-`Phase Name`)

wind

is.na(wind$County) # there are some na values

write.csv(wind, "Wind_Power.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```



## Oil and Gas
Production and reserves sheet has information on quantity of fuel produced.
Main data sheet does not, but it has lat, long, state, and county data. Both have unit ID. Merge both datasets.
```{r}
# production and reserves data
prodres <- read_excel("Global-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction-Tracker-Feb-2025.xlsx", sheet = "Production & reserves")
head(prodres)
colnames(prodres)

# get only us prodres
prodres_us <- prodres %>% filter(`Country/Area`=="United States")


# main data
main <- read_excel("Global-Oil-and-Gas-Extraction-Tracker-Feb-2025.xlsx", sheet = "Main data")
head(main)
colnames(main)

# get us only main
main_us <- main %>% filter(`Country/Area`=="United States")


# combine by Unit ID - inner join, returns fuel plants that are in BOTH datasets only
oilgas <- inner_join(main_us, prodres_us, by = "Unit ID")
head(oilgas)
nrow(oilgas) # 5954 obs
colnames(oilgas)


# filter columns
  # all fuel related data should come from only the prodres sheet
oilgas <- oilgas[, c("Unit ID", "Subnational unit (province, state)", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Status", "Status year",
                     # vars from prodres sheet:
                     "Production/reserves", "Fuel description", "Data year", "Quantity (converted)", "Units (converted)")]

# filter rows
unique(oilgas$Status) # filter status as operating and in dev
oilgas <- oilgas %>% filter(Status==c("operating", "in development"))

unique(oilgas$`Production/reserves`)
# cumulative production is total production - we don't want this
# only keep production and reserves (annual avgs)
oilgas <- oilgas %>% filter(`Production/reserves`==c("production", "reserves"))

# seems like a different unit is associated with each type of fuel
unique(oilgas$`Units (converted)`)
unique(oilgas$`Fuel description`)


# create csv
write.csv(oilgas, "Oil_Gas_Fuel.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```


## Counties CSV
```{r}
county <- read.csv('windfuel_counties.csv')
head(county)
colnames(county)

# there are a lot of na values in a lot of columns
# some states are missing
unique(county$State)
```
